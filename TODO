- add some error handling when user tries to log in with invalid + non-existing credentials

- actually just about all error handling on client side as well

- on client side, do not allow user to access AddPostPage without signing in first 
    (look into react router - is there a common pattern used when using with react router?)

- clicking submit button of sign in / sign up page closes the dialog right away. (which shouldn't)
maybe because the state changes when user's sign in / sign up request is successful so the dialog is re-rendered with initial state? 
   
- architect the redux state
    How to do I go about editing a post?

- when logging in with email, if user signed up using his/her gmail account, 
let user just sign in with the google account instead
